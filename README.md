# Auditory Cortex hemispheric asymmetry
Accompanying repository to Ruthig, Müller et al. (in prep)

This repository contains all neccessary code to reproduce the analysis pipeline and Fig2 and Fig3. 
For Fig2: Download the data from the Bioimage archive (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/bioimages/studies/S-BIAD1077) and separate the channels to retrieve the MBP (myelin) and autofluorescence channels, then save them separately and insert the path into the Python scripts.  
For Fig3: In order to run the code, you will need to insert the data files from Bioimage archive (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/bioimages/studies/S-BIAD1077) to the folder `fig3/data_from_bioimg_arx`.
